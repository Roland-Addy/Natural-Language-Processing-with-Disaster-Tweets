# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets
This data science project is based on a kaggle competition! Social media is undeniably the most important platform of communication in these times. It enables people to express their feelings, thoughts or opinions in real time. Hence news agencies and disaster relief organizations use social media in monitoring for potential emergency announcements for prompt responses. This project seeks to build a machine learning model to classsify tweets that announce emergencies or disasters and those that do not.

## Data Description
